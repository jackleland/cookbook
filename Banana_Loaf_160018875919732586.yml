  A warming banana loaf recipe, made using the ripest bananas. This deliciously moist loaf cake, best served in thick slices, is one of Mary Berry's most popular recipes.
ingredients: |
  100 g butter (softened)
  175 g caster sugar
  2 eggs
  2 ripe bananas (mashed)
  225 g self-raising flour (or 2 tsp baking powder with plain)
  1 tsp baking powder
  2 tbsp milk
directions: |
  Lightly grease the loaf tin and line it with non-stick baking parchment. Pre-heat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4. Measure all the ingredients into a mixing bowl and beat for about 2 minutes, until well blended; an electric mixer is best for this but of course you can also beat by hand with a wooden spoon.
  Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and level the surface. Bake for about 1 hour, until well risen and golden brown. A fine skewer inserted in the centre of the cake should come out clean.
  Leave the cake to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then loosen with a small palette knife and turn the cake out. Remove the lining paper and leave on a wire rack to cool completely. Slice thickly to serve.
