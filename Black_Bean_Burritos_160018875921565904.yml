  These black bean burritos are the weeknight dinner you need in your life. Made with layers of spicy black beans, coconut rice, and creamy avocado slices!
ingredients: |
  1 jalapeno pepper
  2 tins black beans
  3 garlic cloves (minced)
  2 tsp dried oregano
  15 g coriander (fresh)
  1 onion (diced)
  2 tsp ancho chile flakes
  2 tbsp lime juice
  2 tbsp ground cumin
  250 ml water
directions: |
  While the rice cooks, coat the bottom of a large skillet with oil and place it over medium-high heat.
  Give the oil a minute to heat up, and then add the onion.
  Sauté the onion for about 4 minutes, until soft and just beginning to brown.
  Stir in the garlic, jalapeño pepper, cumin, ancho chile powder, and oregano.
  Sauté everything for about 1 minute more, until very fragrant.
  Stir in the beans and 1/2 cup of water.
  Bring the water to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the beans soften up a bit, adding more water as it dries up in the skillet.
  Use a fork or potato masher to mash about half the beans.
  If needed, stir in more water to get your filling to your desired consistency, and heat for another minute, then remove the skillet from heat.
  Stir in the lime juice, cilantro, and salt to taste. Adjust any other seasonings to your liking.
