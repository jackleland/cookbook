  Heat oil and add two crushed cardamon seeds and cloves
  When oil is bubbling, add onion and turn heat down low to sweat onion until it starts to brown (~10-15 mins)
  Add garlic and cook for a couple of minutes
  Melt butter and add spice mix,  and add more oil (if needed) to make a paste. Cook for a couple of minutes
  Add your ficken. Add small amounts of hot water to de-glaze the plan if needed (if it gets a bit crusty)
  Add chickepeas, coconut milk and cream (alternatively, chickpeas can be roasted for 30-40 minutes in oil and salt and be added at the end)
  Simmer for 10 minutes or until ficken is hot and flavours have gelled. Season as needed.
