  Alex cooked for veggie tasting menu
ingredients: |
  12 pitted green olives (roughly chopped)
  1 tin red kidney beans
  1 tin plum tomatoes
  1 tsp cayenne pepper
  600 g butternut squash (peeled and cut into cubes)
  200 g piquillo pimiento peppers (or 2 roasted Romano peppers, roughly chopped)
  1 red chilli (deseeded and finely chopped)
  1 bay leaf
  0.5 vegetable stock cube
  175 ml soured cream
  3 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
  150 ml red wine
  1 small bunch chives (snipped)
  2 onions (chopped)
  1 tsp dried oregano
directions: |
  If using fresh tomatoes, pour boiling water over them in a bowl, count to 30, then lift out, peel and chop.
  Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan with a lid and add the onions and garlic. Soften gently, stirring occasionally. Stir the chilli, cayenne, oregano and bay leaf into the onions. Stir-fry for 1 min, then stir in the squash, olives and wine. Simmer for a couple of mins, stirring, then add the tomatoes and 200ml water. Crumble in the stock cube and stir. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 30 mins, stirring occasionally.
  Add the peppers to the pan and check the seasoning. Add extra water if it’s looking dry. Cover and cook for a further 25-30 mins until the squash is tender. Can be frozen at this stage for up to 1 month – defrost overnight in the fridge before continuing with the recipe.
  Add the beans to the pan and reheat. Serve with chives and soured cream on the side.
