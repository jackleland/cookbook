notes: |
  Love it or hate it, Marmite works beautifully with cheese and onion when baked up in shortcrust parcels
ingredients: |
  100 g soft breadcrumb
  2 tbsp Marmite
  200 g cheddar (grated)
  500 g shortcrust pastry
  500 g potato (peeled and grated)
  2 eggs
  1 bunch spring onions (thinly sliced)
directions: |
  Put the grated potato, cheese, breadcrumbs and spring onions into a mixing bowl with 1 egg. Sprinkle over 1 tsp salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Mix together.
  Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to just slightly thicker than a £1 coin. Use a 16-17cm saucer or bowl to cut out 6 circles of pastry – you may need to re-roll trimmings to get the last one. Warm the Marmite in a small pan or in the microwave with a splash of water so it is a bit runnier, then brush over each circle, leaving a 2-3cm border around each edge.
  Divide the filling between the middles of each circle, then beat remaining egg and brush a little around each border. For each, bring up 2 sides of pastry to meet over the filling, and pinch and crimp to seal into a pasty shape. If eating straight away, transfer pasties to a baking sheet and chill while you heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Or leave on the tray, wrap well in cling film and freeze for up to 3 months.
  Brush the pasties all over with more egg. Bake for 50 mins-1 hr until golden brown and crisp. Eat warm, or cool, in the next 24 hrs.
