  These Vegan Crab Cakes are crunchy on the outside, yet moist and flaky on the inside. They can be enjoyed as an appetizer, side or a main dish.
ingredients: |
  1 tsp garlic granules
  60 g mayonnaise
  1 spring onion (sliced)
  1.5 tsp Old Bay Seasoning (or any seafood seasoning)
  4 tbsp chikpea liquid
  1 tsp Dijon mustard
  1 tin hearts of palm (drained, rinsed and cut in half)
  1 tsp lemon juice
  1 tbsp dried parsley
  120 g golden breadcrumbs
  1 tin chickpeas (save the liquid)
  1 tsp worcestershire sauce
  2 tsp kelp granules
directions: |
  In a food processor add the garbanzo beans and hearts of palm together. Pulse just a few times to break it up. Don't pulse too many times or it will turn to mush. It should have a crab-like consistency. You can also do this manually, just use a fork or your hands to shred everything up. Set aside.
  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the reserved liquid (from the beans) well, until it's slightly foamy. Then add the vegan mayonnaise, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and all the dry seasonings. Whisk to combine well.
  Now add the bread crumbs, green onion, and hearts of palm and garbanzo bean mixture. Gently fold to combine. Taste for salt or seasoning, add more if needed. Pop the mixture in the freezer for 20 minutes. This helps the mixture stay together a bit better.
  Place enough breadcrumbs onto a shallow plate that will coat patties evenly. Take mixture out of freezer. Place about 1/4 cup of mixture into your hands to form a ball. Then gently flatten to form it into a patty shape. Coat patty in the bread crumbs on each side. Place aside and continue until the mixture is gone.
  Heat a large skillet over medium heat (about 2-3 minutes). Add about 2 tablespoons of oil and wait until it gets hot and shimmery before adding the patties. If you place the patty in the pan, and you hear it sizzle, it's ready.
  Place about 4-5 patties on your pan at one time, but make sure you don't overcrowd the pan because they won't cook properly. Pan-fry them about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until light golden brown. Try to only flip each patty once. When done, transfer the patties to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Wipe out pan before the uncooked patties are added. Add fresh oil and continue until all patties are complete.
  Serve hot with vegan tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and top with chopped green onions. Enjoy!
