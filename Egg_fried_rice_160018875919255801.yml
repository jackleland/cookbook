notes: |
  Don't call the Chinese takeaway – make your own egg fried rice. Use leftover rice, or cook and dry it on a plate before using so it doesn't stick to the wok
ingredients: |
  250 g long grain rice
  2 spring onions (sliced, to serve)
  4 eggs (beaten)
  1 onion (finely chopped)
  3 tbsp vegetable oil
directions: |
  Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.
  Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.
  Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice – stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve.
