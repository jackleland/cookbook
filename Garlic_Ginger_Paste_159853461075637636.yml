notes: |
  Garlic ginger paste is a great way to simplify Indian cooking if you are getting into it. You can buy it ready made but it's much better made fresh at home.
ingredients: |
  6 oz fresh ginger peeled by weight
  6 oz fresh garlic cloves peeled by weight
  1 Water (enough to get it to puree - ~1/3 cup)
  1 tsp salt
  0.33 cup of vegetable oil
directions: |
  Combine garlic, ginger, oil and salt in a blender.
  Puree, adding water as needed to get the mixture to blend thoroughly.
  Store in the fridge. Discard when the flavours fade.
