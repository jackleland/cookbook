  Recipe created for and owned by The Vegan Society, 2018 Recently, The Vegan Society asked me to help create them a vegan Easter menu, including a starter, main, side and dessert. I was so excited
ingredients: |
  For the sauce:
  1 pinch of salt and pepper
  null:
  2 leeks (trimmed and sliced into discs)
  For the sauce:
  1 tbsp butter
  1 pinch ground nutmeg
  null:
  1 tsp dried mixed herbs
  500 g button mushrooms (sliced)
  For the sauce:
  270 ml milk
  For the pastry:
  1 roll puff pastry
  null:
  3 garlic cloves (minced)
  For the sauce:
  2 tbsp flour
directions: |
  Add the olive oil to a large saucepan on a medium heat. Fry the leeks and garlic for 2 minutes, to soften.  Add the mushrooms, herbs, salt and pepper and stir for a minute. Place the lid on top and cook for 8 minutes Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt the dairy-free butter on medium heat. Add the flour and stir until combined. Slowly add in the milk, a tablespoon at a time and whisk, until you have a smooth thick mixture. Stir in the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper Combine the cooked leeks and mushrooms with the sauce and leave to cool completely Make sure your puff pastry is at room temperature (if using frozen, leave at room temperature overnight) and preheat the oven to 200C.  Add the leek and mushroom mixture to a pie dish and top with the puff pastry, cutting off any excess pastry around the edges.  Crimp the edges using a fork and score a criss-cross pattern on the top with a sharp knife. Finally, dip a pastry brush in the aquafaba  (or a little dairy-free milk) and brush the top of the pie, to help it brown, plus secure the edge of the pie crust to the dish. 8. Cook for 25 minutes until golden brown. Serve straight away.
