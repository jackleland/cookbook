notes: |
  This vibrant soup is fresh-tasting and substantial enough to have for dinner
ingredients: |
  1 onion (chopped)
  800 g potato (small chunks)
  1 L vegetable stock
  350 g frozen peas
  1 handful mint (chopped)
directions: |
  Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then fry the onion for 5 mins until softened. Add the potatoes and stock, then bring to the boil. Cover and simmer for 10-15 mins until tender, adding the peas 2 mins before the end of the cooking time.
  Use a slotted spoon to remove a quarter of the vegetables from the pan and set aside. Blend the remaining vegetables and stock in a food processor or using a hand blender until smooth, then stir through the reserved veg, chopped mint and some seasoning. Serve with bread on the side.
