notes: |
  The naan itself is based mainly on Meera Sodha’s in Made in India (though she adds baking powder for an extra bit of lift) but I have tried lots of different recipes.
ingredients: |
  For the filling:
  6 tbsp desiccated coconut
  70 g unsalted butter
  1.5 tsp sugar
  null:
  450 g self raising flour
  For the filling:
  6 tbsp ground almonds
  null:
  1 tin coconut milk
  For the filling:
  3 tbsp raisins
directions: |
  Pour the coconut milk into a bowl with a pinch of sea salt and add enough flour to create a dough (you might not need it all), bringing it together with your hands.
  On a clean flour-dusted surface, divide into 8 balls, then flatten each into a 10cm round, pushing your fingers into the top to give you a ripple effect. Place on a lightly oiled tray, and cover with a clean damp tea towel until you’re ready to cook.
Working in batches, drizzle a little oil into a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with some of the butter. Once melted, cook a few dough rounds for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and puffed up, then repeat.
  To make the filling, melt the butter on a medium-low heat. Mix in the remaining filling ingredients and leave to cool.
  Take each ball and push some filling into the middle, closing the dough over it. Flatten with your hands and shape into a teardrop or oval (about 20x10cm). Put the prepared naans on floured baking sheets.
  Put a non-stick frying pan over a very high heat until it is really hot. Put a naan into the pan. When it starts to bubble and go brown, turn it over and cook the other side until it is browned in patches. Keep turning it over until it is cooked through, puffed up and scorched here and there.
  Keep warm in a low oven while you finish making the others. Brush with melted ghee or butter and sprinkle with the seeds, if using.
