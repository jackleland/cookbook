notes: |
  Indian restaurants cook a whack of different curries to order. Ever wonder how they do it? They have a secret weapon. They use Indian restaurant curry base.
  
  If you don’t want to wait an hour or more during step 6, you can safely stop after 30 minutes – it’s not the end of the world.
  Don’t worry if you get a bit of “scum” on the surface. Just mix it back in.
  This recipe makes enough for 10-12 curries (restaurant size portions)
  Use within a week or freeze in 2 cup portions (one curries worth)
ingredients: |
  1 cup vegetable oil
  8 large onions (about 2.5 lbs peeled weight)
  1.5 tbsp coriander powder
  1.5 tbsp cumin powder
  15 fresh cilantro stalks with leaves
  15 oz can diced tomatoes (one can)
  1.5 tbsp ginger coarsely chopped
  1.5 tsp salt
  12 cups boiling water
  8 cloves garlic peeled
  1.5 tsp turmeric
directions: |
  Bring the water to a boil (a kettle works well for this).
  Quarter the onions and then break them apart into petals (roughly – two or three petals per quarter)
  Combine all ingredients except tomatoes, bring to a gentle boil and simmer, loosely covered, for one hour. Use a big pot!
  Add tomatoes, stir and simmer an additional 20 minutes
  Let cool slightly. Blend to smooth consistency. Make sure you remove the centre cap from the blender lid and cover the hole with a cloth or you will be cleaning the ceiling. Alternately you can use an immersion blender.
  Wipe out the pot and return pureed curry base and simmer until the oil separates out – this can take an hour or more. Stir the oil back into the base. At this point you can portion out the base into 2 cup portions and freeze if desired.
