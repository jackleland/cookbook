notes: |
  Saag aloo or potato and spinach curry is a classic Indian vegetarian dish. They serve it at just about every restaurant. Why not make it at home?
  
  I’ve used spinach in this saag aloo, but saag refers to a number of leafy greens. It can mean spinach, collard greens or mustard greens. Fresh methi leaves count too.
  
  The word for spinach in Hindi is palak. So this dish is technically palak aloo. But I’m calling it saag aloo.
  
  Panch phoran is Bengali five spice. It is a mix of whole cumin seeds, brown mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds and fennel seeds. You can mix your own, buy it in an Indian supermarket, or leave it out.
ingredients: |
  0.5 tsp panch phoran
  2 tsp tomato paste diluted to the consistency of passata
  0.5 tsp kosher salt
  1 tsp salt
  0.5 tsp mustard seed
  2 tsp garlic ginger paste
  1 tsp kashmiri chili powder
  0.5 tsp turmeric
  0.5 tsp cumin seed
  1 green chili diced
  0.5 tsp kasoor methi - dried fenugreek leaves
  12 oz curry base
  6 oz potatoes small waxy potatoes are best
  3 oz spinach cooked chopped and drained weight (frozen works fine)
  1 tsp Indian restaurant spice mix
  1 tsp lemon juice about 1/6 of a lemon
  2 tbsp oil
directions: |
  Cut the potatoes into 3/4 inch pieces. Cover with water. Add the salt and turmeric. Bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are just tender. Drain and let cool.
  Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seed, mustard seed and panch phoran. When the whole spices start to crackle add the potatoes. Cook until the potatoes start to turn golden. Remove the potatoes from the pan.
  Return the pan to the heat. Add enough oil to get to two tablespoons. Stir in the green chili. Cook for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Add the garlic ginger paste and cook until it stops spattering. This takes under a minute.
  Turn the heat down to medium low. Add the Indian restaurant spice mix, kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt. Stir to combine. Cook for about 30-45 seconds. You want your spices to lose their raw flavour but don't want them to burn. Watch closely. Lift the pan away from the heat if you have to.
  Add the diluted tomato paste and stir. Turn the heat up to medium high.
  Add half (6 oz) of the curry base. Cook until it starts to form craters. This takes about 2 minutes. Add the rest of the curry base. Repeat.
  Turn the heat down to medium low. Add the potatoes, drained spinach and lemon juice. Simmer for 4-5 minutes.
  Serve.
