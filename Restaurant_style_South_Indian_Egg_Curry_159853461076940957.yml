  If you haven't read about Indian restaurant technique yet, do that before you start cooking (https://glebekitchen.com/2017/01/18/indian-restaurant-curry-at-home/)
  Have all your ingredients prepped and ready to go.
  If you are making multiple curries, have your curry base warming in a pot on the stove. If you are just making one, microwave it to warm it up right before you start cooking.
ingredients: |
  0.5 tsp kashmiri chili powder or .25 tsp cayenne mixed with .75 tsp paprika
  3 tbsp oil (mustard or vegetable)
  0.25 tsp cumin seed
  15 oz curry base
  1 green chili diced
  2 tsp indian restaurant spice mix or curry powder recipe link below
  0.5 tsp kosher salt
  0.5 tsp mustard seed
  1 tbsp tomato paste with enough water to dilute to the consistency of pasatta
  2 tbsp tomato diced (1 tomato)
  0.25 tsp dried fenugreek leaves
  2 cinnamon stick cassia bark
  2 green chilies cut in half lengthwise and then into 0.75 inch pieces. (Seed the chilies to tame the fire a bit)
  12 curry leaves (Fresh, not dried - if you cant get them fresh leave them out)
  0.25 tsp black pepper
  3 cardamom pods green
  1 tbsp garlic-ginger paste
  0.5 cup coconut milk
  4 eggs hard-boiled
directions: |
  Prepare the eggs (ignore if you're happy hard-boiling eggs):
   - Place the eggs in a saucepan. Add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch (so the highest point on the eggs is one one inch under water)
 - Place the saucepan over medium high heat and bring to a boil. As soon as it comes to a boil move it off heat and cover the pan. Set a timer for 9 minutes
 - While the timer counts down prepare an ice bath. Add a bunch of ice and water to a large bowl. It will need to hold the eggs fully submerged so pick the right bowl
 - When the timer goes off, drain the eggs and place them in the ice bath. Leave them there until they are cold. This takes around 10 minutes.
 - Peel the eggs. Slice them in half right before you start making the curry.
  Make the spice mix.
  Dilute the tomato paste with enough water to get to the consistency of passata.
  Heat your frying pan (recipe doesn't recommend non-stick, I've found it to be fine) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil. Use all the oil specified - it's important.
  When the oil starts to shimmer add the cardamom and cinnamon stick. Cook until little bubbles form. This takes 20-30 seconds.
  Now add the mustard and cumin seed. Stir and cook until the seeds start to crackle. This takes another 20 seconds or so.
  Add the garlic ginger paste and green chilies to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste stops sputtering.
  Turn down the heat and add the spice mix. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn.
  Turn the heat up to medium high. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
  Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until bubbles form (little craters really), around 30 seconds. Watch the edges of the pan. The curry can stick here.
  Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
  Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form. Turn the heat down to low. Add the coconut milk and stir.
  Mix in the curry leaves and remaining diced green chili. Simmer for about 3-4 minutes.
  Add the diced tomatoes. Stir to combine. Add the eggs and cook until the eggs are just warmed through.
  Serve with rice / parathas / chapatis / naan.
