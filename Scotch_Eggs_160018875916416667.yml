  Combine two winning dishes in this picnic-friendly recipe of eggs coated in spiced, herbed chickpeas
ingredients: |
  0.5 bunch coriander (leaves only)
  3 tbsp sesame seed
  2 garlic cloves (crushed)
  1 tin chickpeas (drained)
  25 g panko breadcrumbs
  3 onions (chopped)
  1 tbsp ground coriander
  5 tbsp plain flour
  1 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for rolling)
  1 tbsp ground cumin
  200 g wholemeal breadcrumb
  9 eggs
directions: |
  Put n-1 of the eggs in a pan of cold water. Bring to the boil, cook for 5 mins, then quickly lift out of the pan and plunge in a big bowl of cold water to cool. Once cool enough to handle, peel.
  While the eggs cool, put the oil, onions and garlic in a frying pan. Fry very gently until really soft and just starting to turn golden. Add the spices and fry for a few mins more. Tip into a food processor and whizz to a paste, then add the chickpeas and coriander leaves, and pulse until finely chopped but not pasty. Stir in the wholemeal breadcrumbs, flour and final egg, beaten first with a fork, with a good amount of seasoning.
  Divide the mixture into n. Take a portion at a time and flatten between your hands (rub your hands with a little more oil if itâ€™s sticking to your fingers too much). Roll 1 of your peeled eggs in a little flour, shake to remove the excess, then wrap the falafel mixture around it, moulding it to completely cover the egg and squishing it together at the joins to seal. Repeat to cover all the eggs. Tip the panko or dried breadcrumbs onto a plate and mix in the sesame seeds. Roll each egg in it to coat. Can be made 1 day ahead, loosely covered with cling film and chilled.
  Bake in the oven at Universal Cooking Temperature for about 20 mins or until brown.
