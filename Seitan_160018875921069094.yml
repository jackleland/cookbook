  - Tried with 'chicken' broth
ingredients: |
  Broth:
  6 cups vegetable broth
  1.5 tsp poultry seasoning
  0.5 tsp liquid smoke
  Dough:
  235 ml water
  Broth:
  1.5 tsp white wine vinegar
  0.5 tsp garlic granules
  Dough:
  35 g chickpea flour
  Broth:
  15 g yeast flakes
  1 tsp onion powder
  Dough:
  120 g vital wheat gluten
  Broth:
  60 ml soy sauce
directions: |
  Stir the vital wheat gluten and chickpea flour together in a medium bowl.
  Add the water and stir to form a soft dough.
  Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead it for 5 minutes.
  Allow the dough to rest for 5 minutes.
  While the dough rests, stir all of the broth ingredients for your choice of broth together in a large pot.
  Place the pot over high heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat to a low simmer.
  Cut the dough into at least 4 large pieces, or if you prefer, smaller strips or chunks.
  Add the dough to the broth.
  Allow the broth to simmer for 1 hour, uncovered, watching closely to ensure it stays at a low simmer (don't allow it to rapidly boil).
  Remove the pot from heat and allow it to cool a bit.
  When the seitan is cool enough to handle, you can cut it into smaller pieces if you like. Use it in a recipe immediately, or store it in the broth. Refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze.
