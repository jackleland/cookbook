  A fantastic, syrupy microwave sponge pudding, great for when you need a quick fix dessert.
ingredients: |
  100 g butter
  2 tbsp milk
  2 eggs
  100 g self-raising flour
  100 g granulated sugar
  2 tbsp syrup
directions: |
  In a microwavable bowl, put the jam or syrup so that it covers the bottom. This will be the top of your cake.
  Here it is best to use a food processor, although if you want to you can do it by hand. Put all of the remaining basic ingredients into a bowl (or the mixer) with one of the flavour ingredients. If you want to, you can keep it plain.
  Mix or blend all of the ingredients together until smooth.
  Put in bowl on top of jam/syrup and microwave without a lid on full for 5 mins. Leave for 1-2 mins to stand.
