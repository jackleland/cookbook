  Stuffed marrow is one of my favourite meals. I first tried it when Scott’s Mum cooked some for us a few years ago. She stuffed hers with pork mince and I loved it at the time but I can’…
ingredients: |
  1 tin chopped tomatoes
  1 red pepper
  100 g cheddar (grated)
  1 marrow
  2 garlic cloves (minced)
  0.5 red chili
  1 onion
  2 handfuls of fresh herbs
  1 tin kidney beans
  2 teaspoons milled flax
  1 tbsp tomato paste
directions: |
  Preheat your oven to 200C/180C fan (gas mark 6.)
  Prepare marrow rings
Leave the skin on and chop your marrow in to 1.5 inch slices. Scoop out the centre and arrange flat in a baking dish — it is important they sit flat or the filling will spill out.
Marrow rings
Prepare the filling
0 Heat the olive oil in a pan. Fry your chopped onions and peppers with garlic and chilli until just softened. Add the tomato puree (stir to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Once you have a nice paste add the chopped tomatoes and herbs, flax and then beans. Simmer until saucy and season well. Marrow doesn’t have much flavour so don’t be afraid to add a few extra herbs, salt or pepper.)
3 Spoon in to rings
1 Fill the centre of each marrow ring with bean mixture. It will sink down as it cooks so pile the beans nice and high. Don’t add the cheese yet!
1 Marrow filling4. Bake
1 Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes.
0 After 20 minutes remove the foil and sprinkle grated cheese over each ring. Be as generous or as frugal as you like with the cheese. We love it so ours are always cheesy!
1 Bake for a further 15 minutes uncovered until the cheese is bubbling and golden and the marrow is tender.
5 Enjoy
1 Serve and enjoy!
1 On this occasion we ate ours with homemade chips — perfect for soaking up any leftover sauce.
1 In case you were wondering (the world marrow record is 68kg. Makes our 2kg marrow look like a peanut. Oh well, there’s always next year.)
