  3 tbsp cider vinegar

directions: |
  Mix tamari or soy sauce and apple cider vinegar in a bowl until well combined.
  Add the tofu cubes and let rest for at least 5 minutes.
  Drain the tofu and transfer 1/3 of the tofu cubes to a freezer bag with 2 tbsp of cornstarch and toss to coat. Repeat this step with the rest of the tofu and cornstarch. Add more cornstarch if needed.
  Cook the tofu cubes in a skillet with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil over medium-high heat until all sides are golden brown. Remove tofu from pan and set aside.
  Cook the veggies in the skillet with some water or oil over medium-high heat until golden brown. Set aside.
  To make the sauce just mix all the ingredients until well combined.
  Add the sauce to a saucepan and cook until it thickens, stirring frequently.
  Mix the tofu, veggies and sauce in the skillet, stir and cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Serve with some sesame seeds on top (optional).
  Keep leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge for 4 to 5 days.
