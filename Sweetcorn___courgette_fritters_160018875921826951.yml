  An easy, vegetarian fritter you can have on the table in 25 minutes. Top with an egg with a runny yolk and a drizzle of our chilli dressing
ingredients: |
  50 g courgette (grated)
  40 ml milk
  2 spring onions (finely chopped)
  1 egg (beaten)
  1 lime (juiced)
  200 g can sweetcorn (drained)
  50 g self-raising flour
  4 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
  1 tsp smoked paprika
directions: |
  Mix the sweetcorn, spring onions, courgette, paprika, flour, beaten egg, milk and some seasoning in a large bowl and set aside.
  Put a large pan of water on to boil. In a bowl, mix the chilli sauce with the lime juice and set aside.
  Heat the oil in a large, non-stick pan and spoon in four burger-sized mounds of the fritter mixture, spaced apart (you may need to do this in two batches). When brown on the underside, turn over and cook for 3 mins more until golden.
  Meanwhile, poach the eggs in the simmering water for 2-3 mins until cooked and the yolks are runny. Remove with a slotted spoon. Serve the fritters topped with a poached egg, mixed leaves and a drizzle of the chilli dressing.
