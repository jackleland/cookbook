  This quick and easy recipe will show you how to make homemade tzatziki, a great accompaniment to barbecues or a Greek mezze platter.
ingredients: |
  2 tbsp lemon juice
  1 cucumber
  350 g greekstyle yoghurt
  2 garlic cloves grated finely
directions: |
  The best result is achieved by peeling and de-seeding the cucumber before grating. Hang the grated cucumber in muslin cloth or a tea towel in order to squeeze out all the excess liquid, if you like.
  Combine the yoghurt, cucumber, lemon juice and garlic. Add a dash of olive oil and sprinkle with paprika.
