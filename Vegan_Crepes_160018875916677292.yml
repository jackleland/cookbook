notes: |
  Vegan crepes are easy sweet french crepes 100 % eggless and dairy free.
ingredients: |
  1 tbsp of vegetable oil
  560 ml oat milk
  115 g plain flour
directions: |
  In a blender add all the ingredients.
  Blend on high speed for 30 seconds. Stop, scrap the side of the blender and blend again for 30 seconds.
  Transfer the batter into a bowl.  If you don't have a blender, feel free to combine all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl using a whisk to avoid lumps.
  Heat a lightly oiled crepe pan over medium/high heat. I recommend to use coconut oil and to rub the oil onto the pan using a piece of absorbent paper to avoid adding too much oil.
  Scoop the batter onto the pan, then tip and rotate the pan to spread batter as thinly as possible.
  Brown on both sides about 1-2 minutes on each sides and serve hot with your favorite fillings.
